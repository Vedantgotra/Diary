The Fixed Auctions Are :
* Base price issue
* Select product button, select product issue (need to ask the similarities beetween these issues)
* Auction Duration
* updated or edit auction product(already fixed)
* free plan (remaining)
* Auction time
* Auction product(need to ask)
* Auction List Improvement
* edit auction end time(need to ask)

the issues are fixed which is as :

* base price can not be greater than reserve price
* select products button in batch auction is fixed as there will be two variable in the cache productIdArray and productPaginationArray
  - these array do the working of storing data in localstorage of select button history when we selcect the product and change the page it will store the product into the pagination array and at the time of save it will copy the data from pagination to product array in the local storage.
* auction from time and end time should not be less than current time check 
* auction end time should not be greater than start time
* batch action -> batch auction
* no records found to list of auction and product manage.twig 
* there are some things regarding the end auction end time which is the to date can never be less than from date and also from date can never be less than current date also the event is set on changing the value of from date then it will change the value of to date.

@Vinay Durgapal 
Sir, I have made some changes to the user interface of the Wix auction application.
I have made numerous changes, so I can't specify the locator's name. However, here is a list of the path of the pages I've modified in the application.
1. manage/products
2. manage/auctions
3. create/auction
4. view/auction
5. bids/auction
6. company/profile
7. company/profile/settings
8. settings/email
9. settings/general
10. support
11. subscription
12. subscription/transactions
13. subscription/transaction_view
Additionally, I have changed the names of classes and IDs of the HTML elements on the pages. However, due to major updates, I had to change the positions of these elements.

@Ajeet Singh - Salesforce / SAAS Integration @Gautam Bagchi 
Sir, I have fixed the seller plan mail issue in BigCommerce Marketplace as follows:
1. I have added some cases in which emails should be sent and updated the email body heading as mentioned.
2. According to the current flow, when a seller creates an account, a plan-assigned email is sent, along with the existing emails sent to the admin and the seller. If we consider when the seller creates an account and their status changes to 'active,' a total of 4 emails are sent to the seller, including 'Profile Under Review,' 'Profile Info,' 'Plan Assigned,' and 'Status Updated.' At the same time, 2 emails will be received by the admin, including 'Profile Review' and 'Plan Assigned.'
3. Also, when a seller or admin upgrades a seller's plan, a plan upgrade email will be sent to the seller and admin .
4. Finally, when a seller's plan renews, a seller plan renewed email will be sent only to the seller. 

I have also attached the screenshots of the mail which i had tested.

ticket wix auction. ***

video recording related to this ticket. 




Upon closer examination, we determined that the problem does not originate from the auction app. 
Specifically we have created a product without adding auction to that and we do not able to see the cart button and price etc on the product page, it can be associated with your site configuration in which you have not displayed these neccassary field on the product page.  
Additionally, we have tested auction app with the product test auction page which we created yesterday it, as a result we found that the auction app seems to be work good. and the message "Auction ended for this product" is only displyed to non winner we have tested from two diffrent account where winners, see the normal page. This behavior is consistent with the site's configuration, which does not display the necessary fields for winners, i have also attached a recorded video please find below.




Upon closer examination, we found that the issue is related to the product configuration on your website. Specifically, it was discovered that a product had been created without the inclusion of an auction component. Consequently, the "Add to Cart" button, as well as pricing information, were not visible on the product page. This suggests a potential oversight in your site's product page configuration, where essential fields for purchasing a product may not have been displayed.

Furthermore, we conducted testing on a dedicated test auction page that was created recently. The results indicate  As you mentioned, there does not appear to be any issue with the auction winner display, as it correctly shows "Auction ended for this product" for non-winners. However, we did observe that for winners, the screen appears blank. This behavior is consistent with the site's configuration, which does not display the necessary fields for winners.



tasks: 

replied to the ticket. ***
i have to close all the checks of rakhi webhook in mp and close his tickets. 

now catching the js callbacks and async by today. *
studied points: 

* js events handleEvent method inside an object or solve the exersise of the event on javascript.info
* studied the callbacks in which studied need of callbacks and callbacks style coding when loading the script but variables of the script are not loading. 
* also explored some more concepts like callback hell and pyramid of doom its problem comes when we have so much nested callback call one * after solving this by making function more info : https://javascript.info/callbacks#pyramid-of-doom
* 





We have observed that when we sync the product category of one store, it causes the previously synced category to disappear if we sync the category of another store

chatgpt application comment - 
@Rishabh Singh - Salesforce / SAAS Integration 
*Sir, the ChatGPT URL mismatch issue is occurring due to the generation of authentication URLs during the application sync process. 
*According to the code, the application URL is only synced for the first time. Now, if we open the PAM using different origins and server such as 'webhook-staging,' 'wix.webkul,' or 
 'bigcommerce.webkul,' it generates the authentication URLs for the application based on the url.

-For example, I am sharing an image that illustrates the authentication URLs generated on the 'webhook-staging' server, and these URLs have been modified as per the server URL. 
After syncing the application the auth urls will also generate the same as server url. that's why we are getting this url mismatch problem.

P1 Git issues: 
 
#32: commented and assigned to the tester **
#34: the deleted product from wix not delete the product of the application even after sync the application. 
	after deleting a product from wix it also deleting from our aplication but if auction is created previously then it will delete the product but do not delte the auction.  **

#56: on searching auction products add to cart appears this issue was previously it can be happen this issue is reopen due to branch not on staging. **


#59: reopen.  same as 56**

#64: need to meeting.  **

#67: The Embedded Script is not working on the New product page

maybe the embedded scrpt not working on the product page but the page shown in the issue is old page and i have verified on the vijay sir account it is running and auction is showing on the page. 

#72: when placing a bid with increment feature with incremeent value 5 and base price 10 then it creates problem it shows undefined on 20
no problem is shown at my end now i will check at vijay sir account. sir problem with get id null with auctin message is getting on staging account. **

#78: problem when opening page from auction products to shop then it do not hide the active product price. **


no problem at my side see to the sir side. no problem at sir side.


#79: same as 32 the auction product is deleted from wix and still we can set auction **
yes

roadMap for years: 



    To help give you something of an outline, here is something I wrote for another guy a few weeks ago that I think it could be helpful for you too. I’ve added a few things as well. You may know some of this already, but since I don’t know what you do and don’t know I’m gonna include everything I can to make this understandable to someone with no knowledge. Please keep in mind, learning all of the stuff below took me years and years. I had many, many private lessons and spent stupid money trying to figure this stuff out. So if you don't understand anything on your first pass or you get frustrated, keep that in mind. It takes a long time to really start to see all of this stuff come together. With that in mind...

    First, figure out where all of the notes are on a guitar neck. Next, I would recommend understanding the major scale. It’s really just eight notes in an order, where the notes are separated by a pattern of half steps and whole steps. For example, C major is CDEFGABC. If you count through this major scale, you'll notice that the pattern of half steps and whole steps between the notes is: Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half. If you start with any note and follow that pattern, you'll have a major scale for that starting note. For example, the G major scale is GABCDEFsharpG. Go through that scale yourself and count the whole steps and half steps and you'll find the same pattern. Again, this works for any note. One thing to know is that each note in the major scale is called a "degree" of the major scale. For example, in C Major, C is the first degree (or I), D is the second (or II) and so on. Another thing to note about the major scale is that notes are separated by "intervals". So, for example, in the C major scale, the "second" of C is E, the "third" of C is E, and so forth.

    Once you understand what the major scale is, then learn to play the major scale up and down the neck. One way to do this is by using the CAGED system. There are a number of videos on YouTube that describe this system. It's essentially just five patterns on the neck where the patterns map to the notes of a major scale. Each of these patterns also include a chord shape within it.

    If you already know the CAGED system, I wouldn't learn any other scales for now. Instead, I would recommend starting to dig into the major scale deep. Here are some of things I mean:

        Learn that each degree of the major scale has a function: 1 - tonic, 2 - supertonic, 3 - mediant, 4 - subdominant, 5 - dominant, 6 - submediant, flat 7 - subtonic, natural 7 - leading tone. Learn how each of these sound in the context of the scale as a whole. For example, the supertonic (2), subdominant (4), and the leading tone (7) are all degrees that rarely resolve well (i.e., you don't want to end on those notes most of the time). However, the mediant (3) sounds great to resolve on because it colors the whole scale. What I mean by "colors" is that if you were to flat the third degree of the scale, you would get a minor sound (i.e., sad) instead of a major sound.

    Once you learn how these different degrees function, I'd recommend learning how to resolve to those different degrees when playing. For example, learn a classic blues lick and figure out what degree that lick ends on. Does it end on the root? The third? the flat seventh? What kind of story do each of those licks tell and how does that resolving note color that story? At the same time, I'd recommend developing a deep memorization of where certain degrees are within each of the CAGED shapes. This way when you play you can focus on telling a story that gets back to whichever degree you want to talk about.

    After you get comfortable with the above, learn that each degree in the major scale corresponds to a a particular chord that is included within the major scale. Take the C Major scale for example. The C Major scale has the following chords within it: C Maj (CEG), Dm (DFA), Em (EGB), F Maj (FAC), G Maj (GBD), Am (ACE), B dim (BDF). If you don't know this already, learn that each major chord consists of three notes: the 1st, 3rd, and 5th degrees within their respective major scale. Minor chords are 1-flat3-5. Diminished chords are 1-flat3-flat5. There are other fancier chords you can learn later, but those do a good job at the beginning. Another pattern you can memorize is that the chords within any major scale follow the same pattern: Major (M) - minor (m) - m - M - M - m - diminished (dim). So, for a different example, in the key of G major we know the notes are GABCDEFsharpG. Just by memorizing that pattern I know that the following chords lie within the G major scale: G Maj - A min - B min - C Maj - D Maj - E min - Fsharp dim. Again, this pattern applies to all major scales.

    After you learn which chords fall within a major scale, you can really start to understand underlying chord progressions, chord tones, and how to play over various chords. So if you're playing a I-IV-V chord progression in C Major (so, C Maj - F Maj - G Maj), you now have the tools to know which degrees of the C major scale sound which way over a various chord. For example, in the above I-IV-V chord progression, you know that resolving a lick to the root over the I chord will sound good. However, you also know that the IV contains a C, so you can resolve to the root on the IV as well. The only difference is that you're now playing the fifth degree of the IV chord rather than the first degree, which gives the resolve a different flavor. Many musicians sit at this level for years, which is fine because it takes a long time to really get a good feel for it all.

    After you feel comfortable with the above, I'd recommend digging into modes. This is just another trick to give your licks a certain type of flavor over underlying chords.

    After that or at the same time, I'd recommend learning arpeggios and how to develop phrases around various arpeggios.

    There is a lot to learn in between all of the above, and you may know a good bit of it already, but if you don't that should give you a very good place to start (at least in terms of what to google).

    On top of JustinGuitar, I would also recommend Ross Campbell’s bulletproof guitar player course that came out a week or two ago. It's a bit better than Justinguitar in my opinion and it's only $12 a month. He gives great explanations of what I wrote above. I’ve been playing for a while now and I even purchased it to backfill any issues I might have.

    So to sum this up (TL;DR): learn notes --> learn major scales --> learn the function of each degree of the major scale --> learn the chords of the major scale --> learn to play the major scale over chord progressions --> learn chord tones over chord progressions --> learn modes over chord progressions. This will give you a solid foundation. Then you can incorporate more exotic scales (minor, melodic minor, bop scales, etc.) and more exotic chords (7th chords, 9th chords, sus2/4, etc.).

    If any of that assumed too much knowledge please let me know and I would be happy to fill in any of my assumptions.

    And as a final note, just learn songs from tabs and play them with your friends. I did that for years and those were often the most informative times. They're also easier to keep doing consistently because they're the most fun (which is what guitar is all about).
